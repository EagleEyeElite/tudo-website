# TODO List
- have in the .env file a variable that defines dev or prod or maybe test mode
- edit the script for wordpress start, to run in dev or in prod mode
- make nextJS server as docker? - maybe just for prod?
- add Readme that explains purpose of this project, give commands to start this project quickly
- maybe talk about wordpress cms backups?
